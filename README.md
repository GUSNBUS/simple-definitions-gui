# simple-definitions-gui
So I am reading a book, and it's in my native language. Problem is, there are some huge words in there that I don't know because it is a different Spanish to what I speak in house. I decided to create a simple GUI that you can store words and definitions in. I know tools like this exist but this would be better if I did it as a project for myself
